                <h2>
                    What is an IP address?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The internet links billions of devices across the world.
                    Each device on the internet has a unique address which can be
                    represented by a number that is unique. A computer address is
                    called an IP address (meaning "Internet Protocol").
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>
                    How do IP addresses work and why are they important?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    IP addresses have a hierarchy. Each of the numbers is
                    represented by bits. The numbers identify the region/country,
                    then the subnetworks, and finally the address of the specific device. You can
                    picture an IP address as a domestic address,
                    each part of the address will give
                    you specific information about the location of a building just like each
                    part of group of bits in an IP address will lead you to a specific website.
                    As you can see, without a system of domestic addresses it would be
                    challenging to find your friend's house in the whole planet. Similarly, without
                    IP addresses we would not be able to locate websites.

                </p>
                <br>
                <h2> How does information travel?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Information travels as a "packet" from one computer to another.
                    However there are some limits! Some information needs to be broken down into
                    smaller pieces to be able to send them more effectively. These packets might
                    reach their
                    destinations on separate times but at the end it works just as if you had sent
                    a large packet because the information will meet at the planned
                    destination. For example, images can be broken down into multiple packages.
                    each package will travel separately but
                    it will then find a path towards the same destination and form the
                    original whole picture as intended.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Where does information travel?</h2>
                <p>
                    Router is what keeps paths for the packages to drive through.
                    Routers offer multiple
                    paths for liability.
                    The more routers we have, the more reliable the internet becomes because we
                    have more "roads" for the packets to travel through, therefore, less chance
                    of congestive traffic.
